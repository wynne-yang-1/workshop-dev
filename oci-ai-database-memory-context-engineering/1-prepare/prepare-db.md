# Lab 1: Prepare Development Environment

## Introduction

As part of the Sandbox environment, an Autonomous Database running Oracle AI Database 26ai has already been provisioned for you. You'll need Microsoft Visual Studio Code installed on your own laptop / PC to complete the workshop.

In this section you'll get your IDE prepared, connect to the Oracle Autonomous Database, then create a VECTOR user for use in the subsequent labs.

**Estimated Time:** 15 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

1. Log into the provided OCI tenancy
2. Review and connect to the Autonomous Database that was provisioned for you
3. Create a dedicated user for vector operations

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

- Provisioned the Workshop using the LiveLabs Sandbox
- Retrieved your account credentials from the LiveLabs UI
- Installed Microsoft VS Code Community Edition

## Task 1: Log into the OCI Tenancy

... 
    DO WE HAVE: existing instructions we can pull to show how to 
    retrieve credentials in LiveLabs and log into the tenancy?
...

## Task 2: Locate and review the Oracle AI Database 26ai instance

1. Update ACL to include your IP (click the slide button) and save.

    SCREENSHOT

2. Update mTLS - not required

    SCREENSHOT

3. Click the **[Database connection]** button at the top of the screen. Locate and copy the full **Connection string** for the TNS name that corresponds with `medium`. (Paste in a note pad for future reference)

    SCREENSHOT

4. Time to set up VS Code

## Task 3: Open VS Code and Create Jupyter environment

For this lab, you will create a new `.ipynb` file and copy in the code to prep the database. in future labs, we've provided the `.ipynb` file to streamline these activities.

1. Open VS Code and close any existing tabs. 


2. Create a new Workspace: **File** -> **Open Folder**

3. Select an existing folder where you'd like to create your workspace, or create and select a new folder.

    SCREENSHOT

4. 

Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` and begin typing "Jupyter". It should auto-populate the option to `Create: New Jupyter Notebook`. Select this option.

2. Paste the following and press the Run arrow on the left side of the code block:

    ```
    <copy>
    pip install --upgrade pip
    </copy>
    ```

3. Press the **[+ Code]** button at the top of the notebookt add a new Code block. Paste the following and run the code block:

    ```
    <copy>
    pip install -qU oracledb langchain-oracledb langchain langchain-openai langchain-huggingface ipywidgets tavily-python sentence-transformers
    </copy>
    ```

    >NOTE: This will perform a quiet install that takes 3-5 minutes. No output will be diplayed until it completes.

4. Test to make sure the Python modules were installed properly. Create a new code block, then paste and run the following:

    ```
    from openai import OpenAI
    from langchain_huggingface import HuggingFaceEmbeddings
    import oracledb
    ```

    >NOTE: No output is displayed unless there are errors. If you see a green check mark, all is well!


## Task 4: Connect to the database and create VECTOR user

1. Now test the connection using the OracleDB driver for Python. Paste the following code and be sure to replace the `your_dsn` text with the value you copied in Task 2.

    ```python
    <copy>

    import oracledb
    import os
    import getpass

    # Store username, password, and DSN
    adb_password = getpass.getpass("Database password: ")
    vector_password = getpass.getpass("Enter password for VECTOR (e.g. MemoryContext_2026): ")
    adb_dsn = os.environ.get("DB_DSN", input("Database DSN copied earlier: "))
    adb_user = "ADMIN"
    vector_user = "VECTOR"


    try:
        connection = oracledb.connect(
            user=adb_user,
            password=adb_password,
            dsn=adb_dsn
        )

        print("Connection Successful")

        with connection.cursor() as cursor:
            cursor.execute("SELECT banner FROM v$version WHERE banner LIKE 'Oracle%'")
            banner = cursor.fetchone()[0]
            print(f"\n{banner}")
            
    except oracledb.Error as error:
        print(f"Error connecting to the database: {error}")

    finally:
        if 'connection' in locals() and connection:
            connection.close()
            print("Connection Closed.")
    </copy>
    ```

3. Create the VECTOR user.

    ```python
    <copy>

    def setup_oracle_adb(
        create_vector_user=True,
        vector_user=vector_user,
        vector_password=vector_password 
    ) -> bool:
        """
        Connect to Oracle Autonomous Database and create VECTOR user
        
        Args:

            vector_user: Username for the vector user
