# Lab 2: Vector Search Foundations

## with Oracle AI Database 26ai and LangChain OracleVS

--------

### Objectives

In this activity, you'll learn how to store and search documents using **semantic similarity** — finding results based on meaning rather than exact keyword matches. This is the foundation that powers every memory type we'll build in later activities.

You'll work with **NovaTech Solutions' IT knowledge base**: internal documentation, runbooks, and incident reports that our AI support agent "Atlas" will use to resolve tickets.

### What You'll Learn

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **1. Initialize Embeddings** | Load a HuggingFace embedding model to convert text into vectors |
| **2. Create Vector-Enabled Table** | Set up an Oracle-backed vector store with cosine distance via `OracleVS` |
| **3. Create Index** | Build an HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) index for fast similarity search |
| **4. Add Documents** | Store NovaTech IT knowledge base articles with metadata |
| **5. Query** | Search for similar documents using natural language |
| **6. Filter Results** | Use metadata filters to narrow down search results |

### Key Components

- **`OracleVS`**: LangChain abstraction over Oracle vector-enabled SQL tables
- **`HuggingFaceEmbeddings`**: Converts text to 768-dimensional vectors
- **`DistanceStrategy.COSINE`**: Measures vector similarity using cosine distance
- **HNSW Index**: Graph-based ANN index for fast and accurate nearest-neighbor retrieval

## Task 1: Connect to Oracle AI Database

Your environment has been pre-configured with Oracle AI Database 26ai running locally. The `VECTOR` user and connection details are ready to use.

```python
import oracledb
import time
import logging

def connect_to_oracle(
    max_retries=3,
    retry_delay=5,
    user="VECTOR",
    password="VectorPwd_2025",
    dsn="127.0.0.1:1521/FREEPDB1",
    program="novatech.atlas.workshop",
):
    """
    Connect to Oracle database with retry logic and helpful error messages.
    """
    for attempt in range(1, max_retries + 1):
        try:
            print(f"Connection attempt {attempt}/{max_retries}...")
            conn = oracledb.connect(
                user=user, password=password, dsn=dsn, program=program
            )
            print("✓ Connected successfully!")

            with conn.cursor() as cur:
                cur.execute("SELECT banner FROM v$version WHERE banner LIKE 'Oracle%'")
                banner = cur.fetchone()[0]
                print(f"\n{banner}")

            return conn

        except oracledb.OperationalError as e:
            error_msg = str(e)
            print(f"✗ Connection failed (attempt {attempt}/{max_retries})")

            if "DPY-4011" in error_msg or "Connection reset by peer" in error_msg:
                print("  → Database may still be starting. Retrying...")
                if attempt < max_retries:
                    time.sleep(retry_delay)
                else:
                    raise
            else:
                raise

    raise ConnectionError("Failed to connect after all retries")
```

```python
vector_conn = connect_to_oracle()
print("Using user:", vector_conn.username)
```

--------

## Task 2: Initialize Embeddings and Create a Vector-Enabled Table

We'll use the `sentence-transformers/paraphrase-mpnet-base-v2` model to convert text into 768-dimensional vectors. OracleVS handles the table creation, embedding storage, and similarity search under the hood.

```python
from langchain_oracledb.vectorstores import OracleVS
from langchain_community.embeddings import HuggingFaceEmbeddings
from langchain_oracledb.vectorstores.oraclevs import create_index
from langchain_community.vectorstores.utils import DistanceStrategy

# Suppress verbose logging from langchain_oracledb
logging.getLogger("langchain_oracledb").setLevel(logging.CRITICAL)

# Initialize the embedding model
embedding_model = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(
    model_name="sentence-transformers/paraphrase-mpnet-base-v2"
)

# Create the vector-enabled SQL table via OracleVS
vector_store = OracleVS(
    client=vector_conn,
    embedding_function=embedding_model,
    table_name="VECTOR_SEARCH_DEMO",
    distance_strategy=DistanceStrategy.COSINE,
)
```

### Create an HNSW Index

HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) is a graph-based approximate nearest-neighbor index. It provides fast, accurate similarity search at scale — essential when your knowledge base grows to thousands or millions of documents.

```python
def safe_create_index(conn, vs, idx_name):
    """Create index, skipping if it already exists."""
    try:
        create_index(
            client=conn,
            vector_store=vs,
            params={"idx_name": idx_name, "idx_type": "HNSW"},
        )
        print(f"  ✅ Created index: {idx_name}")
    except Exception as e:
        if "ORA-00955" in str(e):
            print(f"  ⏭️ Index already exists: {idx_name} (skipped)")
        else:
            raise


safe_create_index(vector_conn, vector_store, "oravs_hnsw")
```

--------

## Task 3: Ingest NovaTech IT Knowledge Base

In a real deployment, this data would come from Confluence, ServiceNow, or internal wikis. Here we'll seed the knowledge base with representative IT support articles that Atlas will use to resolve tickets.

```python

# Prepare texts and metadata for ingestion

    metadata_list.append({

# Ingest into the vector-enabled table
vector_store.add_texts(texts=texts, metadatas=metadata_list)
print(f"✅ Ingested {len(texts)} NovaTech KB articles into VECTOR_SEARCH_DEMO")
```

--------

## Task 4: Querying with Natural Language

Now let's see the power of semantic search. Unlike keyword search, vector similarity finds documents based on *meaning*. A query about "login problems" will match articles about AUTH-SVC and SSO — even if those exact words don't appear in the query.

### Basic Similarity Search

```python
query = "Users can't log in to any applications this morning"

results = vector_store.similarity_search(query, k=3)

for i, doc in enumerate(results, start=1):
    print(f"--- Result {i} ---")
    print("Title:", doc.metadata.get("title", "N/A"))
    print("Team:", doc.metadata.get("team", "N/A"))
    print("Text:", doc.page_content[:200], "...")
    print()
```

> **🔍 Notice** how the search returns AUTH-SVC and authentication-related articles even though the query didn't mention "auth", "SSO", or "Kubernetes". That's semantic similarity at work.

### Search with Relevance Scores

Scores let Atlas gauge confidence. A score close to 0 means high similarity (cosine distance); a score near 1 means low relevance.

```python
query = "The VPN keeps disconnecting on my laptop"

results = vector_store.similarity_search_with_score(query, k=3)

for doc, score in results:
    print(f"Score: {score:.4f}")
    print(f"Title: {doc.metadata.get('title', 'N/A')}")
    print(f"Team:  {doc.metadata.get('team', 'N/A')}")
    print("------")
```

--------

## Task 5: Filtered Search with Metadata

In a real IT support system, Atlas needs to narrow results by category, severity, or owning team. OracleVS supports metadata filters that combine with vector similarity.

### Filter by Category

```python
query = "something is wrong with the kubernetes cluster"

docs = vector_store.similarity_search(
    query,
    k=3,
    filter={"category": {"$eq": "infrastructure"}},
)

for doc in docs:
    print("Title:", doc.metadata.get("title", "N/A"))
    print("Severity:", doc.metadata.get("severity", "N/A"))
    print("Text:", doc.page_content[:150], "...")
    print("------")
```

### Filter by Severity (Critical Issues Only)

```python
query = "What are the most important incidents I should know about?"

docs = vector_store.similarity_search(
    query,
    k=5,
    filter={"severity": {"$eq": "critical"}},
)

for doc in docs:
    print("Title:", doc.metadata.get("title", "N/A"))
    print("Team:", doc.metadata.get("team", "N/A"))
    print("------")
```

### Filter by Team

```python
query = "What does the Platform Team own?"

docs = vector_store.similarity_search(
    query,
    k=5,
    filter={"team": {"$eq": "Platform Team"}},
)

for doc in docs:
    print("Title:", doc.metadata.get("title", "N/A"))
    print("Category:", doc.metadata.get("category", "N/A"))
    print("------")
```

--------

## Lab 2 Recap

You've now built the search foundation that Atlas will rely on:

| What You Did | Why It Matters |
|-------------|----------------|
| Created a vector-enabled SQL table | Documents stored with embeddings for semantic retrieval |
| Built an HNSW index | Fast approximate nearest-neighbor search at scale |
| Ingested NovaTech KB articles | Real IT support data with rich metadata |
| Queried with natural language | "Users can't log in" finds AUTH-SVC articles without keyword matching |
| Applied metadata filters | Narrow results by category, severity, or team |

**Next up**: In Activity 2, we'll design the complete memory architecture that gives Atlas six distinct types of memory — each with a specific purpose and storage strategy.
