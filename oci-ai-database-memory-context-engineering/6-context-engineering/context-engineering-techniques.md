# Lab 6: Context Engineer Techniques and More

## Introduction

While memory engineering focuses on what to store and retrieve, context engineering focuses on how to manage what's in the context window right now. This includes monitoring usage, compressing information, and providing just-in-time access to details.

>NOTE: Context engineering refers to the set of strategies for curating and maintaining the optimal set of tokens (information) during LLM inference, including all the other information that may land there outside of the prompts.
