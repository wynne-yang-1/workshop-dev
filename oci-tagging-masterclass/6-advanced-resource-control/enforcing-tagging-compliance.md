# Lab 6: Enforcing Tagging Compliance with OCI Functions

## Introduction

In the previous labs, you created tags, applied defaults, managed costs, and defined access control policies — all foundational elements of a tagging strategy. But what happens when a resource is created without the required tags, or when someone removes a tag after the fact? Without enforcement, even the best tagging strategy will degrade over time.

In this lab, you will implement automated enforcement of your tagging policies using OCI Functions and the Events service. You will build two serverless functions written in Python:

1. **A scheduled compliance scan** that searches for non-compliant compute instances across a compartment and stops them.
2. **An event-driven function** that is triggered automatically whenever a new compute instance is launched, checks whether it has the required tags, and stops it immediately if it does not comply.

Together, these two patterns cover both retroactive enforcement (catching existing non-compliant resources) and proactive enforcement (catching non-compliant resources at the time of creation).

**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

- Create a Dynamic Group and IAM policies to authorize OCI Functions to manage resources in your compartment.
- Create an OCI Functions application and configure it for your compartment and VCN.
- Deploy a Python function that scans for non-compliant compute instances and stops them.
- Create an Events rule that triggers a function whenever a new compute instance is launched.
- Deploy a second Python function that evaluates newly launched instances for tag compliance and stops non-compliant instances automatically.
- Test both enforcement patterns by creating compute instances with and without the required tags.

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

- Completed the previous labs in this workshop (specifically, you should have a tag namespace and defined tags already created).
- Access to OCI Cloud Shell or a local development environment with the Fn CLI and OCI CLI installed and configured.
- A Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) with at least one subnet in your workshop compartment.
- Familiarity with the OCI Console navigation.

## Task 1: Create a Dynamic Group and IAM Policies

Before your functions can interact with other OCI services — such as querying for compute instances or stopping them — you must authorize them using a Dynamic Group and IAM policies. A Dynamic Group allows you to treat functions as principals (similar to users) and grant them permissions through policy statements.

1. Open the **Navigation Menu** in the OCI Console, navigate to **Identity & Security**, and select **Dynamic Groups**.

2. Click **Create Dynamic Group** and enter the following:

    - **Name:** `FunctionsTagEnforcement`
    - **Description:** `Dynamic group for tag compliance enforcement functions`
    - **Matching Rule:** Enter the following rule, replacing `<compartment_ocid>` with the OCID of your workshop compartment:

    ```
    ALL {resource.type = 'fnfunc', resource.compartment.id = '<compartment_ocid>'}
    ```

    This rule includes all functions deployed in your workshop compartment.

3. Click **Create**.

4. Next, navigate to **Identity & Security > Policies** and click **Create Policy**. Enter the following:

    - **Name:** `TagEnforcementPolicy`
    - **Description:** `Allows tag enforcement functions to manage resources`
    - **Compartment:** Select your workshop compartment.

5. Add the following policy statements (click **Show manual editor** to enter them):

    ```
    Allow dynamic-group FunctionsTagEnforcement to manage instance-family in compartment <your_compartment_name>
    Allow dynamic-group FunctionsTagEnforcement to read all-resources in compartment <your_compartment_name>
    Allow service cloudEvents to use functions-family in compartment <your_compartment_name>
    ```

    The first statement allows the functions to stop and terminate compute instances. The second allows them to search and read resource details. The third allows the Events service to invoke functions in your compartment.

6. Click **Create**.

## Task 2: Create a Functions Application

A Functions application is a logical grouping of functions. It defines the network (subnet) that your functions will use to communicate with other OCI services.

1. Open the **Navigation Menu**, navigate to **Developer Services**, and select **Functions**.

2. Make sure you are in your workshop compartment, then click **Create Application**.

3. Enter the following:

    - **Name:** `tag-enforcement-app`
    - **VCN:** Select the VCN in your workshop compartment.
    - **Subnet:** Select a subnet (a private subnet with a service gateway or a public subnet will work).

4. Click **Create**.

5. On the application detail page, note the **Getting Started** section. If you are using OCI Cloud Shell, follow the Cloud Shell setup steps. If you are using a local environment, follow the local setup steps to configure the Fn CLI context for your application.

    The key commands are:

    ```bash
    fn list context
    fn use context <your_region>
    fn update context oracle.compartment-id <your_compartment_ocid>
    fn update context api-url https://functions.<your_region>.oraclecloud.com
    fn update context registry <region_code>.ocir.io/<tenancy_namespace>/tag-enforcement
    ```

    > **Note:** If you are using Cloud Shell, the context is typically pre-configured. You may only need to set the compartment and registry.

## Task 3: Deploy the Scheduled Compliance Scan Function

This function scans all compute instances in a specified compartment using the OCI Resource Search service. For each instance, it checks whether the required defined tag is present with the expected value. If an instance is non-compliant, the function stops it.

This function is designed to be invoked on a schedule (for example, using the OCI Resource Scheduler or an external cron trigger) to periodically sweep for resources that have drifted out of compliance.

1. In Cloud Shell or your local terminal, create a new function boilerplate:

    ```bash
    fn init --runtime python scheduled-tag-scan
    cd scheduled-tag-scan
    ```

2. Open the `requirements.txt` file and replace its contents with:

    ```
    fdk>=0.1.74
    oci>=2.110.0
    ```

3. Open the `func.yaml` file. Increase the timeout and memory to accommodate the scan operation:

    ```yaml
    schema_version: 20180708
    name: scheduled-tag-scan
    version: 0.0.1
    runtime: python
    build_image: fnproject/python:3.11-dev
    run_image: fnproject/python:3.11
    entrypoint: /python/bin/fdk /function/func.py handler
    memory: 512
    timeout: 120
    ```

4. Replace the contents of `func.py` with the following code:

    ```python
    import io
    import json
    import logging

    import oci
    from fdk import response

    # Configure logging
    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

    ```

5. Deploy the function to your application:

    ```bash
    fn deploy --app tag-enforcement-app
    ```

6. Before invoking the function, set the required configuration variable. Navigate to your **Functions Application** in the OCI Console, select the **Configuration** tab, and add the following key:

    | Key | Value |
    |-----|-------|
    | `COMPARTMENT_OCID` | The OCID of your workshop compartment |
    | `TAG_NAMESPACE` | The tag namespace you created in a previous lab (e.g., `Operations`) |
    | `TAG_KEY` | The tag key to enforce (e.g., `CostCenter`) |

    > **Note:** Setting these values as application-level configuration variables allows you to change the enforcement criteria without redeploying the function code.

7. Test the function from Cloud Shell or your terminal:

    ```bash
    fn invoke tag-enforcement-app scheduled-tag-scan
    ```

    The function will return a JSON response indicating how many non-compliant instances were found and what actions were taken.

    > **Tip:** To test this safely, create a small compute instance without the required tag and verify that the function stops it. You can then add the required tag to the instance and re-run the scan to confirm it is no longer flagged.

## Task 4: Deploy the Event-Driven Compliance Function

The scheduled scan from Task 3 is useful for catching existing non-compliant resources, but there is a gap between scans where a non-compliant resource could be running. To close that gap, you will now create a function that is triggered by the OCI Events service whenever a new compute instance finishes launching.

When the Events service detects that a compute instance has been created, it sends the event payload to the function. The function then reads the instance OCID from the event, retrieves the instance details, checks for the required tag, and stops the instance if it is non-compliant.

1. From Cloud Shell or your terminal, create a new function:

    ```bash
    fn init --runtime python event-tag-check
    cd event-tag-check
    ```

2. Replace the contents of `requirements.txt`:

    ```
    fdk>=0.1.74
    oci>=2.110.0
    ```

3. Replace the contents of `func.yaml`:

    ```yaml
    schema_version: 20180708
    name: event-tag-check
    version: 0.0.1
    runtime: python
    build_image: fnproject/python:3.11-dev

            }),
            headers={"Content-Type": "application/json"}
        )
    ```

5. Deploy the function:

    ```bash
    fn deploy --app tag-enforcement-app
    ```

6. Set the same configuration variables on this function (or on the application, which will be inherited by both functions):

    | Key | Value |
    |-----|-------|
    | `TAG_NAMESPACE` | Your tag namespace (e.g., `Operations`) |
    | `TAG_KEY` | Your tag key (e.g., `CostCenter`) |

## Task 5: Create an Events Rule

Now that the event-driven function is deployed, you need to create an Events rule that triggers it whenever a new compute instance is launched in your workshop compartment.

1. Open the **Navigation Menu**, navigate to **Observability & Management**, and select **Events Service > Rules**.

2. Click **Create Rule** and enter the following:

    - **Display Name:** `enforce-tags-on-instance-launch`
    - **Description:** `Triggers tag compliance check when a compute instance is launched`

3. Under **Rule Conditions**, configure the following:

    - **Condition:** `Event Type`
    - **Service Name:** `Compute`
    - **Event Type:** `Instance - Launch End`

4. To scope the rule to your workshop compartment only, add an additional condition:

    - Click **+ Another Condition**.
    - **Condition:** `Attribute`
    - **Attribute Name:** `compartmentId`
    - **Attribute Values:** Enter the OCID of your workshop compartment.

5. Under **Actions**, configure:

    - **Action Type:** `Functions`
    - **Function Compartment:** Select your workshop compartment.
    - **Function Application:** `tag-enforcement-app`
    - **Function:** `event-tag-check`

6. Click **Create Rule**.

    The rule is active immediately. Any compute instance that finishes launching in your workshop compartment will now trigger the `event-tag-check` function.

## Task 6: Test the Enforcement

You now have two enforcement mechanisms in place. Let's test them.

### Test the Event-Driven Enforcement

1. Navigate to **Compute > Instances** and click **Create Instance**.

2. Create a small instance (for example, using the `VM.Standard.E4.Flex` shape with 1 OCPU and 1 GB memory). **Do not add any defined tags** — leave the tagging section at its defaults.

3. After the instance reaches the **Running** state, the Events service will fire the `Instance - Launch End` event. Within a minute, the `event-tag-check` function will be triggered.

4. Navigate back to your instance. You should see that its state has changed to **Stopping** or **Stopped**.

5. To verify, check the function logs. Navigate to **Developer Services > Functions**, select your application, then select the `event-tag-check` function and click **Logs**. You should see log entries indicating the instance was found to be non-compliant and was stopped.

### Test with a Compliant Instance

1. Create another small instance, but this time, expand the **Tagging** section during creation.

2. Under **Defined Tags**, select your tag namespace (e.g., `Operations`), select the key (e.g., `CostCenter`), and assign a value.

3. After the instance reaches the **Running** state, wait for the function to be triggered.

4. This time, the instance should remain running. The function logs should show that the instance was evaluated and found to be compliant.

### Test the Scheduled Scan

1. If you still have the non-compliant instance from the first test (now stopped), start it again from the Console or add another instance without the required tag.

2. Invoke the scheduled scan function manually:

    ```bash
    fn invoke tag-enforcement-app scheduled-tag-scan
    ```

3. Review the JSON output. It should report the non-compliant instance and confirm that it was stopped.

## Task 7: Clean Up (Optional)

If you want to remove the resources created in this lab:

1. Delete the Events rule (`enforce-tags-on-instance-launch`).
2. Delete the functions and the application (`tag-enforcement-app`) from the Functions console.
3. Delete the IAM policy (`TagEnforcementPolicy`).
4. Delete the Dynamic Group (`FunctionsTagEnforcement`).
5. Terminate any test compute instances you created.

You may now proceed to the next lab.
